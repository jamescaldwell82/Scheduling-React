Cloud Functional Code



Testing Functionality


V2 Functionality
 - Authentication - I plan to integrate Google Authentication and allow this application to be a little bit more dynamic and usable. Right now, the functionality is there per the Mininum Viable Product laid out in the persona. However while it showcases mimimal filtered data-driven views, the UI/UX still feel quite limiting due to the current mock-auth setup.
- Function Triggers - After creating the original functions, I found documentation on Firebase Function triggers that you can set up for handling creations and updates of data in Firestore. I would like to spend some time integrating this functionality utilizing those funcitons that help extend the database.

Overall this was a really great project to help me understand how cloud functions can be utilized to protect data-sensitive functionality in React Development.
